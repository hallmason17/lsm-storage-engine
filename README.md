# LSM Storage Engine

Building an LSM-tree storage engine in C++ from scratch for learning.

## Goal
Understand how databases like RocksDB work by implementing the core concepts myself.

## Status
Implementing everything naively first and optimizing later.

- [ ] Basic MemTable
- [ ] Write-ahead log
- [ ] SSTable format

## Building
```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Learning Resources
- CMU 15-445 Database Systems
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications (Kleppmann)
- LevelDB source code

## Progress
